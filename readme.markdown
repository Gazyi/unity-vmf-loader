Import maps created for the [Source
Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)) in
[Hammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor) to
[Unity](http://unity3d.com/). Currently only brush geometry and lights are
imported, but the plan is to import all assets that the map uses as well â€“
everything from textures to models. Existing solutions such as vtf2tga and
Crowbar will be used to accomplish this part.

Installation
============

Installation is a bit weird at the moment. Basically just toss everything in
the "Assets" to a new folder inside your own "Assets" folder. This will be
improved in the future.

Usage
=====

1.  Create a new scene or open the scene you want the map to be placed in.
2.  Drag the VMF file to assets.
3.  Done!
